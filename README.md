## Serverless HQ
Serverless made quick & easy. This is your home base for quick & powerfully easy scaffolding for your next Serverless project.

### Background & Why
Serverless Framework is fantastic, but it's hard to manage several Serverless services together and get them sharing resources, let alone sharing data models with each other.

Serverless HQ gets us a slightly opinionated abstraction layer for your Node application. Rather than obfuscating Serverless, HQ instead stiches any number of SLS services together. HQ gets you shared libraries, data modeling, and even utilities that are consistently available across your services.

And we've shoved all of this into an easy-to-manage NPM package. So as SLS improves, we can manage our versions appropriately - without altering your code. (Yay versioning!)

### Getting Started
```npm install serverless-hq --save``` and then run ```sls-hq help`` to get a full list of commands. That's it!
